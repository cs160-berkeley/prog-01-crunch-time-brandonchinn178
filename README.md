# PROG 01: Crunch Time

My app, Calorie Converter, can convert an inputted amount of exercise into number of calories burned. The user can also input the number of calories they wish to burn and the app will give them how many minutes/reps they need to do. A final feature allows the user to time themselves while they exercise and watch how many calories they are burning.
